## Deprecated v1

Long time ago, I started building this with a first approximation to the concept. I was working on it during several months but due to my inexperience and lot of problems found during development, I stopped working on it until now.

Version 2 is being rewritten completely, using another framework (no more Angular) and trying to keep the old backend as it was, as long as possible, but implementing new powerful tools and technics.
